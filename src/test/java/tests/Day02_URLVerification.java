        ===========Approach for Automation========

    1) I read the acceptance criteria very very carefully
    2) I then create my test case
    3) Then I do "Manual Testing" FIRST helps us to undrestand THE APPLICATION
    4) If all above good, I start complete my automation script
    4) If I find any bug/defect, then I talk to dev. Dev fixes the issue, then I reset.If all is good then start my AUTOMATION
    5) when Automation is complete, I prepare the report for the user story. In fact, My Automation script generate html
    reports for us, I upload those reports to the JIRA.
    for my MANUAL test cases, I manually take screenshots and prepare reports and attach them to the JIRA.
-------------------------------------------------
    WHAT DO WE DO WHEN OUR TEST CASE PASS ?
    - Prepare report and upload to JIRA
--------------------------------------------------
    WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOUR TEST CASE FAILS?
    -Retest to make sure from the failure.It can be data issue, typo, documentation issue or is can be a real bug.
    -If that is a bug, then talk to the dev and let them fix the bug.
    -After the fix, we retest. when test cases passes we upload to JIRA
